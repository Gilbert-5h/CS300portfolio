**Project Two.zip**

This C++ program implements an Advising Assistance system for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The application utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to manage and retrieve course information efficiently. The code is organized to meet the specified project requirements and follows industry-standard best practices.

Features
Load Data Structure:

Reads course data from a user-specified file and populates a Binary Search Tree with course information.
Print Course List:

Displays an alphanumeric list of all courses in the Computer Science department, sorted from lowest to highest.
Print Course:

Allows users to look up a specific course by entering the course number. Prints the course title and prerequisites.
Exit:

Provides an option to exit the program.
How to Use
Compile and Run:

Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable.
Menu Options:

Choose from the menu options (1-4) to perform various actions.
Load Data Structure:

Input the file name containing course data when prompted.
Print Course List:

Option 2 displays an alphanumeric list of all courses.
Print Course:

Option 3 allows users to look up and print information about a specific course.
Exit:

Choose option 4 to exit the program.
Additional Notes
Memory Management:

The program manages memory efficiently using a Binary Search Tree.
Error Handling:

Provides error messages for file-related issues.
Input Validation:

Basic input validation is performed, but users are encouraged to provide valid inputs.
Comments:

Code includes comments for better understanding of the logic.
Testing:

Ensure thorough testing with different input scenarios.

**Project Reflection - Advising Assistance Program**

Problem Statement:

The project aimed to create a practical Advising Assistance Program for ABCU's Computer Science department, addressing the challenge of managing course information effectively.

Approach:

I took a step-by-step approach, figuring out the best data structures, implementing pseudocode, and emphasizing the importance of making wise choices in data structure selection.

Why Data Structures Matter:

Understanding data structures became pivotal for writing efficient code, impacting performance, and making the code more understandable and maintainable.

Overcoming Challenges:

Running into challenges during algorithm design prompted me to revisit the basics, conduct iterative testing, and seek guidance from documentation.

Design Approach Evolution:

The project made me rethink how I design software, pushing me to plan systematically and pay more attention to choosing the right data structures for the job.

Writing User-Friendly Code:

Focusing on making the code readable with meaningful names, pseudocode, and effective error handling contributed to a more approachable and user-friendly codebase.

In summary, this project was a learning journey that sharpened my problem-solving skills, emphasizing practical and effective approaches to designing software.
