**Project Two.zip**

This C++ program implements an Advising Assistance system for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The application utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to manage and retrieve course information efficiently. The code is organized to meet the specified project requirements and follows industry-standard best practices.

Features
Load Data Structure:

Reads course data from a user-specified file and populates a Binary Search Tree with course information.
Print Course List:

Displays an alphanumeric list of all courses in the Computer Science department, sorted from lowest to highest.
Print Course:

Allows users to look up a specific course by entering the course number. Prints the course title and prerequisites.
Exit:

Provides an option to exit the program.
How to Use
Compile and Run:

Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable.
Menu Options:

Choose from the menu options (1-4) to perform various actions.
Load Data Structure:

Input the file name containing course data when prompted.
Print Course List:

Option 2 displays an alphanumeric list of all courses.
Print Course:

Option 3 allows users to look up and print information about a specific course.
Exit:

Choose option 4 to exit the program.
Additional Notes
Memory Management:

The program manages memory efficiently using a Binary Search Tree.
Error Handling:

Provides error messages for file-related issues.
Input Validation:

Basic input validation is performed, but users are encouraged to provide valid inputs.
Comments:

Code includes comments for better understanding of the logic.
Testing:

Ensure thorough testing with different input scenarios.

**Data structure Psudocode- Run time analysis for Tree Data structure**

This document provides pseudocode for loading course data into different data structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Tree), searching and printing course information, and includes a runtime analysis for printing course information using a Tree data structure.

Contents:

Vector Data Structure Pseudocode:

Describes the steps to read a file, validate course data, and load it into a vector.
Hash Table Data Structure Pseudocode:

Outlines algorithms for opening/reading a file, validating data, and storing course objects in a hash table.
Improved Pseudocode for Tree Data Structure:

Enhanced pseudocode for a tree data structure, incorporating functions for file processing, validation, and tree operations.
Menu Pseudocode:

Pseudocode for a simple menu-driven program, allowing users to load data, print a course list, print course information, and exit.
Runtime Analysis for Printing Course Information using Tree Data Structure:

Analyzes the time complexity of printing course information in a balanced tree.
Advantages and Disadvantages:

Highlights the pros and cons of Vector, Hash Table, and Tree data structures, aiding in the selection process.

Usage:

Choose the pseudocode that aligns with your preferred data structure.
Implement the provided pseudocode in your C++ program.
Follow the suggested runtime analysis and consider the advantages and disadvantages for informed decision-making.
